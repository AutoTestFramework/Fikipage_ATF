### 1. Project title - Automated Testing Framework (ATF)

* *Test automation provides sanity checks for ever-changing production code. Automation framework consists of the integration of tools, libraries and utilities needed to interact with the system under test. Automated tests are scripted scenarios that drive the framework to query the application through a series of steps, and then use the information the framework gathered to determine the state of your test.* 

### 2. Present the team and assign the roles (such as FR, BE, PO, PM, etc)

* **What we want to achieve?** 
   * Test automation is living, breathing code and is developed to provide sanity checks for ever-changing production code. Building an automated testing framework can make your testing scalable, reliable, efficient, cost-effective and less brittle.

* **What we need?** 
   * The team needed an experienced understanding of software testing and QA to know how to achieve the right balance of manual, UI, integration (API) and unit tests. To achieve that, we create the **AGILE team**:

### 3. Describe the problem that you have noticed

## You would review PRODUCTION code, wouldn't you? You should review test code, too.

  * Tests are part of your product and your team need to design tests as a core feature of your product. The benefits of a stable build aren't always measured using the classic of number of defects found.
  * If your organization is working with agile development methodologies, make sure automation is included in your definition of **"done"** just like any other functional requirement. Then you'll move another step closer to DevOps.
  * We found that:
    * Manual testing is a thing of the past;
    * The current frameworks have limited features;
    * Expensive for what if offers (license or subscription costs of commercial automation solutions);

### 4. Our solutions proposed / value proposition

* Reduce the work of manual testing (time savings + staff performance);
* Earlier bugs identified before the users are impacted (spot smallest imperfections);
* Easy management of the test cases;
* Intuitive GUI that immediately shows when, where and how the execution failed;
* Our solution is to build a framework to help make your test automation code:
  * Reusable AND Maintainable AND Stable
* Benefits for our clients:
  * Reduces the time and effort you need to spend on QA (minimal manual intervention) while providing quick feedback and expanding code coverage => better product
  * Lower maintenace costs: if executed properly, introducing automation into your organization is worth the investment.
  * Better Accesibility & Performance & Security;
  * Mitigate RISK: Can help Stakeholders and POs better manage risk by addressing many of their concerns early in the process. Moreover, the cost of change to a system is greatly reduced by test automation, so it’s much easier when a bug fix or feature enhancement needs to be pushed to production. (production monitoring)
  * Turnaround time
  * Less tester fatigue (time-consuming)
  * Decreased human error

### 5. Customer segment/s

* Corporate IT with complex software solutions;
* Small and medium businesses which contribute with software to the bigger picture;
* Independent people or students working on software projects;

### 6. Competition

### 1. How you identified the problem?

  * Current solutions, while offering lots of features, also introduce a lot of overhead and complicated configurations. Much needed features like the ones proposed are never aggregated into one application(code versioning, cloud storage etc.). Graphical user interfaces are ambiguous due to the need of providing access to every feature;

### 2. What you thought is a solution for the problem?

  * An open-source application model, offering as much extensibility as possible and a freemium-based revenue (from plugins and cloud storage space) with the possibility of donations.
  * The solution has to address the main problems: stick to the most necessary features, maintain a simple interface with great performance, offer plugins for special features.

### 3. Your plan for customer discovery (short overview before going into detail).

  * There are two types of potential customers: 
    * __those who DO__
    * __those who DON'T use automated testing frameworks (but have the need to)__
  * Explain our proposed solutions to both types of customers and gather feedback. For customers who already use an automated testing framework, see which ones are willing to migrate from an existing platform and learn why others won’t (what the reasons are, what features they’re not willing to give up on etc.)

### 4. Describe the process in detail:

#### 4.1 How you identified your customer segment/s?
  
  * The main customers will be the big companies that develop web applications because they spend a lot of time for testing. Any modification to an application requires a complete regression testing of the entire application to see if any other sections of the applications have been affected.
  * At the same time, this testing process should be done as quickly as possible to make changes in production to repair some bugs or to bring new features. The solution for these companies would be to automate this process by writing automated tests and running them quickly on an infrastructure that our application will provide.

#### 4.2 How you reached them, how you collected information from them? Include the questions that you asked and all of your findings.
  
  * To interact with potential clients we decided to contact companies interested in this topic, so we interviewed representatives of the participating companies but also partners of the "ROMANIAN TESTING CONFERENCE" - [Romania_Testing_Conference](https://romaniatesting.ro), which takes place annually in Cluj. 
  * We created an online survey that was distributed to testers within interested companies: [Survey_Automated_Testing_Framework](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfibey92Iiv6dQyhn6W_fFrSSLx5lPOWiEQT81tvh_lGo9Fww/viewform)
  * The survey included the following questions:

  •  Paralel tests
```

# The PROOF!

  ![Screenshot](/survey_responses.jpg)


* Conclusions:
  * From the results obtained through this survey we realized that those interested in automated testing, runs tests locally on theirs PCs, so they could become potential users of our application. People who have an in-house framework will also choose our product.
  * At the same time we found out that 60% do not run the tests every day, so they don't use their infrastructure to the maximum of potential and could reduce costs by running tests in our application on-demand. We also determined that most of users prefer to write tests as code and the most used languages that our application should to support. We also have the list of the most useful and wanted functionalities so we know how to prioritize them for a MVP.

### 5. Describe how these insights have affected your product (if in any way).

  * Complaints about performance on existing products made us decide that special features have to be offered as plugins, instead of being included in the base product, so that the end product would be simple, fast and limited to basic needs, but also feature-filled if necessary. Customers not already using such a framework also wished for fast and simple way to test their applications, without unnecessary complications.

### 6. Do you consider that you are ready to move to the Customer Validation stage (to test selling)? Provide arguments.

  * Considering that we’ve covered all complaints about other existing solutions regarding Automated Testing Frameworks and that most customers are happy with our other proposals, we’re ready to move on to the next stage!!!
