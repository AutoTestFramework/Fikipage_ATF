1. What is ATF? Automated Testing Framework is a web application for creating, administrating and running automated tests.
2. What we want to achieve? Test automation is living, breathing code and is developed to provide sanity checks for ever-changing production code. Building an automated testing framework can make your testing scalable, reliable, efficient, cost-effective and less brittle.
3. What we need? The team needed an experienced understanding of software testing and QA to know how to achieve the right balance of manual, UI, integration (API) and unit tests.
